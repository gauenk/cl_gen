Supervised Burst Methods
- KPN



Big goals are consistency, terminating conditions, and quality for "tough" images.

Questions: Which images do the methods struggle with? How does training impact rec quality (e.g. load from trained each time)? Rather than use "mse_loss" between noisy and rec images, why not use previous rec image vs current rec image to determine "alignment" penalty?

For each noisy burst I want to know:
- Image Index in the Dataset
- Single image denoising PSNR of middle frame
- Baseline: Averaging over burst PSNR

For each method on each image I want to know:
- Peak PSNR overall
- Init and Final PSNR
- Std of Peak PSNR over different model init
- Iteration # of Peak PSNR
- Loss function and PSNR as a function of iterations
- Loss @ (a) init and (b) peak psnr
- Std of PSNR for small region around loss @ peak PSNR (how indicative is Loss for PSNR?)
